        <h3>"About Me"</h3>
        <p>Hi! My name is Max Tauroza. I was born in Hong Kong and have lived in Italy, Syria, Switzerland and the UK. I have a diploma in translation, 10 years of management experience in the hospitality industry and am studying to become a software engineer. </p>
        <p>I began coding for a number of reasons: my lifelong love of languages has me enthralled with the possibilities presented by coding languages, I love the problem solving element that is intrinsic to coding, and I am excited by the future of programming and all that it has to offer.</p>
